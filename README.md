# Project Title

Singtel-Code-Assignment - A. Let’s start with the basics

## Assignment A Let’s start with the basic- 1
1. Can you implement the sing() method for the bird?
```
YES.
Changed the Animal Class as Abstract Class and added the abstract methods
	abstract void fly();
	abstract void sing();
```
a. How did you unit test it?
```
Created a Test Class com.java.singtel.BirdTest.java 
```
b. How did you optimize the code for maintainability?
```
Changed the Animal class initially to Abstract Class.But may be changed to Interface based on future requirements (An interface is better than a abstract class when you want multiple classes to implement that interface and when you don't have to inherit default behavior)
```

### Prerequisites
```
JAVA JRE/JDK and Eclipse IDE 
```
### Installing
```
Eclipse IDE - import the Project as JAVA Project and add the dependencies(if required) 
```
