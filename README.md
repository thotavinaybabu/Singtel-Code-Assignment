Singtel-Code-Assignment - B. Model fish as well as other swimming animals

## Assignment B. Model fish as well as other swimming animals
1. In addition to the birds, can you model a fish?

```
a. Fishes don’t sing
b. Fishes don’t walk
c. Fishes can swim
```
2. Can you specialize the fish as a Shark and as a Clownfish?

```
a. Sharks are large and grey
b. Clownfish are small and colourful (orange)
c. Clownfish make jokes
d. Sharks eat other fish

```
```diff
created a Fish interface. Created classes Shark and Clownfish which implement
Fish Inteface.

```
3. Dolphins are not exactly fish, yet, they are good swimmers
```
a. Can you model a dolphin that swims without inheriting from a fish class?
b. How do you avoid duplicating code or introducing unneeded overhead?
```

```diff
Using Composition(over inheritence) solves the problem .With this we can also avoid duplicating the code
