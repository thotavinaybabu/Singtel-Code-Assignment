Singtel-Code-Assignment - E. Counting animals

## Assignment E. Counting animals
Suppose you have an array of animals, e.g.

```
Animal[] animals = new Animal[]{
new Bird(),
new Duck(),
new Chicken(),
new Rooster(),
new Parrot(),
new Fish(),
new Shark(),
new Clownfish(),
new Dolhpin(),
new Frog(),
new Dog(),
new Butterfly(),
new Cat()
};

```

Note: The above instantiation may be different if you chose to set up your object model
differentlyâ€¦ (hopefully you did)


```
1. Can you share the code to count:
a. how many of these animals can fly?
b. how many of these animals can walk?
c. how many of these animals can sing?
d. how many of these animals can swim?

```
```diff
Added code in  "solution.java"" for counting the number of anmals that can fly,walk,sing and swim for all the animals that were implemented.

```
