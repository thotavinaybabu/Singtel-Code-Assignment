## Assignment A Let’s start with the basic- 3
3. Now how would you model a rooster?

```
a. A rooster says: “Cock-a-doodle-doo”
b. How is the rooster related to the chicken?
c. Can you think of other ways to model a rooster without using inheritance?
```
```
#### Chicken is genderless, hen is the female, rooster is male.So rooster and hen are chickens.Created Rooster.java class extending Chicken.java class.
#### Another way to model a rooster without using inheritence is to use delegation.In Delegation we use an object of another class(here chicken class) as an instance variable, and forward messages to the instance (RoosterDelegation.java).
