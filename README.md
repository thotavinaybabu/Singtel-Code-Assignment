Singtel-Code-Assignment - A. Let’s start with the basics

## Assignment A Let’s start with the basic- 4
4. Can you model a parrot? We are specifically interested in three parrots, one that
lived in a house with dogs one in a house with cats, the other lived on a farm next to
the rooster

```
a. A parrot living with dogs says: “Woof, woof”
b. A parrot living with cats says: “Meow”
c. A parrot living near the rooster says: “Cock-a-doodle-doo”
d. How do you keep the parrot maintainable? What if we need another parrot
lives near a Duck? Or near a phone that rings frequently?
```
```
Implemented Parrot which uses delegation(also Composition) with the method - "livingWith".One has to pass Instance of the Animal that the Parrot is living to get the desire behaviour (singing).Even if the parrot is living with Ducks, it will work.
